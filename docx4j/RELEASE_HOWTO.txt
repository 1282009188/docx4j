docx4j release process
----------------------

[Do this process for a release candidate first]

Check everything is committed

Update Getting Started as necessary (inc HTML and PDF versions)

Check jar versions in pom.xml, build.xml

Update README.txt with release info.

    svn log -r 1073:HEAD > tmp_log_2_4_0.txt
    
(refer to README.txt to see what rnumber to start at)    

Update pom.xml with target version number

svn ci

svn co from command line (ie not in eclipse)

----

Per https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

mvn release:clean

mvn release:prepare

mvn release:perform

perform breaks (1) because target/generated-sources is already under version control (why? get rid of this)

so have to mv target out of the way, svn update, then copy current contents into it

perform breaks (2) because it run in wrong dir, so cd target/checkout/docx4j and manually run it:

$ mvn deploy --no-plugin-updates -Psonatype-oss-release -f pom.xml

(This runs on the branch you've created in previous steps. All the previous steps do is create that branch, and change trunk's pom to whatever next version will be)

Uploading: https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2//org/docx4j/docx4j/2.7.1/docx4j-2.7.1.jar

   2. Go to Staging Repositories page.
   3. Select a staging repository.
   4. Click the Close button.

2. when you are sure the closed staging repository has no problem, click the Release button.

--------

The mvn generated jar is currently bigger (5.6MB), because it contains unnecessary docx.
